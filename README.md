# Veriface ID - Advanced Driver's License Validation

A comprehensive iOS application for detecting and validating driver's licenses using advanced computer vision techniques, face detection, liveness verification, and authenticity checks.

## ðŸš€ Features

### Core Functionality
- **OCR Text Extraction**: Advanced optical character recognition for license data extraction
- **Barcode Scanning**: PDF417 and other barcode format support for machine-readable data
- **Data Validation**: Cross-reference front and back license information for consistency

### Advanced Face Detection
- **Face Detection**: Locate and analyze faces in license photos using Vision framework
- **Quality Assessment**: Evaluate face size, position, and confidence scores
- **Landmark Detection**: Identify eyes, nose, mouth, and face contours
- **Position Analysis**: Determine if face is centered, left, or right positioned
- **Size Evaluation**: Assess face size relative to image for optimal capture

### Liveness Detection
- **Video Capture**: Record short video clips for liveness verification
- **Motion Analysis**: Detect movement between video frames
- **Blink Detection**: Identify natural blinking patterns
- **Head Movement**: Track head position changes over time
- **Liveness Scoring**: Calculate overall liveness confidence score

### Authenticity Verification
- **Digital Manipulation Detection**: Identify signs of photo editing or manipulation
- **Compression Artifact Analysis**: Detect JPEG compression artifacts
- **Noise Pattern Analysis**: Analyze image noise for authenticity indicators
- **Edge Consistency**: Check for natural vs. artificial edge patterns
- **Printing Artifact Detection**: Identify moirÃ© patterns and halftone printing
- **Holographic Feature Detection**: Look for iridescent color patterns
- **Security Feature Analysis**: Detect microtext, guilloche patterns, and UV-reactive elements
- **Consistency Checks**: Compare front and back image quality and color profiles

### User Experience
- **Modern UI**: Clean, professional interface inspired by industry standards
- **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate quality assessment and recommendations
- **Multiple Capture Options**: Camera, photo library, and video capture
- **Comprehensive Results**: Detailed validation reports with confidence scores
- **Incident Reporting**: Built-in reporting system for suspicious documents

## ðŸ›  Technical Implementation

### Frameworks Used
- **Vision**: Face detection, landmarks, and text recognition
- **AVFoundation**: Video capture and processing
- **Core Image**: Image analysis and manipulation detection
- **VisionKit**: Camera integration and document scanning
- **SwiftUI**: Modern user interface

### Best Practices Implemented

#### Face Detection
- Uses `VNDetectFaceLandmarksRequest` for comprehensive face analysis
- Implements confidence scoring based on multiple factors
- Provides actionable recommendations for better capture quality
- Handles edge cases (no faces detected, multiple faces)

#### Liveness Detection
- Frame-by-frame analysis for motion detection
- Temporal consistency checks for natural movement
- Blink detection using face confidence variations
- Head movement tracking with distance calculations

#### Authenticity Verification
- Pixel-level analysis for manipulation detection
- Statistical analysis of color distributions
- Pattern recognition for security features
- Cross-image consistency validation

#### Performance Optimization
- Efficient pixel sampling for large images
- Background processing for heavy computations
- Memory management for video frame extraction
- Cached analysis results for repeated operations

## ðŸ“± Usage

### Basic License Validation
1. Capture front of license (with photo)
2. Capture back of license (with barcode)
3. Tap "Start Advanced Verification"
4. Review comprehensive results

### Liveness Verification
1. Select "Liveness" option for front license
2. Record short video following prompts
3. System analyzes motion and natural behavior
4. Receive liveness confidence score

### Quality Guidelines
- **Lighting**: Ensure even, bright lighting without glare
- **Position**: Center the license in the frame
- **Stability**: Hold camera steady during capture
- **Distance**: Maintain appropriate distance for optimal face size
- **Cleanliness**: Remove dirt, scratches, or reflections

## ðŸ”’ Privacy & Security

- All processing occurs locally on device
- No data transmitted to external servers
- Temporary video files automatically cleaned up
- Secure handling of sensitive document information
- Optional incident reporting for suspicious documents
